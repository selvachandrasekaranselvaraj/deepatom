DeepAtom is a Python package designed for calculating and utilizing various atomic descriptors for machine learning applications in materials science. It includes functionality for:

Descriptors Calculation: Computes a range of atomic descriptors such as Coulomb matrices, sine matrices, Ewald sum matrices, Atom-centered Symmetry Functions (ACSF), Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), and Many-body Tensor Representation (MBTR).
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Implements a GNN model for predicting properties based on atomic structures.
Utilities: Provides functions to handle LAMMPS output trajectory files and convert them into formats suitable for descriptor calculations.
Training and Prediction: Allows training of GNN models and prediction of material properties with saved models.
